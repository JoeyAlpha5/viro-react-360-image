/**
 * ShadowView tree mirrors RCT view tree. Every node is highly stateful.
 * 1. A node is in one of three lifecycles: uninitialized, computed, dirtied.
 * 1. RCTBridge may call any of the padding/margin/width/height/top/left setters. A setter would dirty
 *    the node and all of its ancestors.
 * 2. At the end of each Bridge transaction, we call collectUpdatedFrames:widthConstraint:heightConstraint
 *    at the root node to recursively lay out the entire hierarchy.
 * 3. If a node is "computed" and the constraint passed from above is identical to the constraint used to
 *    perform the last computation, we skip laying out the subtree entirely.
