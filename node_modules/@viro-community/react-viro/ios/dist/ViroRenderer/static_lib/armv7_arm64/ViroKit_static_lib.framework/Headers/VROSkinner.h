 VROSkinner is the base class for skeletal animation; it associates an animation
 skeleton with the geometry that will be deformed.
 
 A single VROSkeleton can be used by multiple VROGeometries; each geometry using
 the VROSkeleton will have its own VROSkinner that maps the geometry to the 
 skeleton.
 
 Brief explanation of coordinate transformations
 ------
 
 Skeletal animation works by associating a geometry with a skeleton. The geometry
 is transformed first so that it aligns with the skeleton, via the _bindTransforms.
 Next, we associate each vertex in the geometry with the set of bones that will
 'influence' it, via _boneWeights and _boneIndices. Then we animate the
 skeleton, specifically by animating each of the bone's transforms. And finally, we 
 deform the mesh to follow the movement of the skeleton.
 
 The steps, in more detail:
 
 1. Bind the geometry to the skeleton.
 
 The position in which our model is encoded in its vertex array is called its
 'original position'. Initially, our model is in its original position, in model
 space. For each vertex we animate, we need to transform it from its original 
 position, model space, to the bind position for the bone that's influencing it,
 in bone local space. Note we do this for every bone that influences the vertex.
 This is the purpose of the geometryBindTransform and the bindTransform for each bone:
 
 Model space, original position  --> [bindTransform] --> Bone space, bind position
 
 2. Animate the skeleton locally
 
 Once we have a vertex in the bind position, bone local space, it can follow the
 animations of the skeleton. To animate, we multiply by the boneTransform. The 
 boneTransform (retrieved via skeleton->getTransform(i) for bone 'i'), transforms
 from the bind position, bone local space to the animated position. The coordinate
 space of the animated position depends on the type of boneTransform used:
 
 [Concatenated bone transform] Bone space, bind position --> [boneTransform] --> Model space, animated position
 [Local bone transform]        Bone space, bind position --> [boneTransform] --> Parent bone space, animated position
 [Legacy bone transform]       Bone space, bind position --> [boneTransform] --> Bone space, animated position
 
 3. Return to model space
 
 If we were using legacy transforms, then we have to return to the model space of the
 geometry with a final transform:
 
 Bone space, animated position  --> [inverseBindTransform] --> Model space, animated position
 
 All transforms listed above are concatenated together by VROSkinner::getModelTransform.
 
 4. Deform the mesh

 All the final bone transforms are then written to the vertex shader via the VROBoneUBO.
 For each vertex of the geometry, we deform by all connected bone transforms. These
 connections are determined by the _boneWeights and _boneIndices. The latter indexes
 into the correct bone transform; the former determines how much influence said bone has
 on the vertex.

     These transforms move vertices from from their original position in model space,
     to the bind position in the local space of the bone at index 'i'.
     
     The purpose of these transforms is two-fold:
     
     1. To place the geometry into the bind pose, the pose at which the geometry
     aligns with the skeleton, and from which its vertices can therefore be animated
     alongside the skeleton's bones.
     
     2. To transform from model space into the coordinate system of a given bone. 
     This way we can animate vertices hierarchically: e.g. a finger vertex can 
     animate around the finger bone, then the elbow, then the shoulder, etc. See
     VROBone.h and getModelTransform() for more details.
     
     Finally, note that the transform at _bindTransforms[i] is for the bone in
     _skeleton.bones[i].
     
     The inverse bindTransforms go the other direction, from bone local 
     space back to model space.
