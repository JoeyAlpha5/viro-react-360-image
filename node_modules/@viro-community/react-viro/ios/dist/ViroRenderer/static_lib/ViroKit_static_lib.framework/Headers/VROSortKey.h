         The std::tie operation perform the sort for us, in order of increasing importance.
         We generally sort by rendering order, opacity (opaque objects first), and
         distance to camera, then by batch switching concerns (shader, textures, light,
         material), and finally by tie-breakers (node,  element index).
         
         For hierarchies, note that the distance from camera for all objects in a hierarchy
         is set to the distance from camera of the parent. This way distance from camera becomes
         irrelevant within a hierarchy, so that within each hierarchy we can sort by hierarchy
         depth only. We also sort by hierarchy ID because we want the entirely of a hierarchy to
         appear continuously in the sort order; this is essential for the deferred depth-write
         rendering to work (see VROPortal::renderContents).

         Note that because hierarchies appear before transparency in the sort order (they must,
         otherwise the hierarchies would not be continuous in the sort order), this means
         hierarchies will not *always* work with transparency. We make hierarchies render first,
         so that they will appear behind other transparent objects. But *transparent* hierarchies
         will not display opaque objects behind them. This is a known limitation with this system.
         Before attempting to fix, look through the git history of this file (it has been tried
         before).
