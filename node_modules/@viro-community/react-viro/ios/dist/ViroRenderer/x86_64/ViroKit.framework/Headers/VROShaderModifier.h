/*
 The entry point, which signals where in the shader program this modifier will
 act.
 
 ----------------
 
 Geometry entry point. The code may declare uniforms and read/write
 to the following structures:
 
 struct VROShaderGeometry {
   vec3 position;
   vec3 normal;
   vec2 texcoord;
   vec4 tangent;
   vec4 bone_weights;
   ivec4 bone_indices;
 } _geometry;
 
 struct VROTransforms {
   mat4 model_matrix;
   mat4 view_matrix;
   mat4 projection_matrix;
 } _transforms;
 
 The Geometry entry point enables modifiers to change vertex parameters
 in the vertex shader. This includes geometry parameters like position,
 normals, and texcoords, and transform parameters like the model, view,
 and projection matrices.
 
 ----------------
 
 Vertex entry point. The code may declare uniforms and read/write
 to the following structure:
 
 struct VROShaderVertex {
   vec3 position;
 } _vertex;
 
 The Vertex entry point enables modifiers to change the position of
 vertices *after* their transformation into normalized device coordinates.
 The input and output (_vertex.position) is in normalized device coordinates.

 ----------------
 Surface entry point. The code may declare uniforms and read/write
 to the following structure:
 
 struct VROSurface {
   lowp  vec4 diffuse_color;
   highp vec2 diffuse_texcoord;
   lowp float diffuse_intensity;
 
   lowp float shininess;
   lowp  vec3 specular_color;
   highp vec2 specular_texcoord;
 
   highp float roughness;
   highp float metalness;
   highp float ao;
 
   lowp float alpha;
   lowp  vec3 normal;
   highp vec3 position;
 } _surface;
 
 The Surface entry point enables modifiers to change surface parameters, in
 the fragment shader, prior to the lighting computation.
 
 ----------------
 
 Lighting Model entry point. The code runs once per light. It reads from the
 _surface structure and the _light structure below, and sets the results in
 the _lightingContribution structure:
 
 struct VROLightingContribution {
     highp vec3 ambient;
     highp vec3 diffuse;
     highp vec3 specular;
     highp float visibility;
 } _lightingContribution;
 
 struct VROLightUniforms {
    int type;
    highp float attenuation_start_distance;
    highp float attenuation_end_distance;
    highp float attenuation_falloff_exp;
 
    highp vec4 position;
    highp vec4 direction;
 
    highp vec3 color;
    highp float intensity;
 
    highp float spot_inner_angle;
    highp float spot_outer_angle;
 } _light;

 The Lighting Model entry point enables modifiers to define the impact of each
 light on a given material. After being invoked on each light, the lighting
 contributions from each light are accumulated and combined with material surface
 properties to generate the final color. The visibility value (which defaults to
 1.0) is multiplied by the diffuse and specular components; it can be used to
 simulate the impact of shadow.
 
 Note, as an optimization, total ambient light is initialized to the sum
 of all ambient lights. Therefore, in general lighting models will not need to
 add anything to _lightingContribution.ambient.
 
 ----------------
 
 Fragment entry point. The code may declare uniforms and read/write
 to the variable:
 
 highp vec4 _output_color;
 
 The Fragment entry point enables modifiers to alter the final color of each
 fragment, after the lighting computation.
 
 ----------------
 
 Image entry point. The image entry point is *only* available for 2D post-processing
 shaders. The code may declare uniforms for the fragment shader (the vertex
 shader is a fixed quad in normalized device coordinates), and must simply
 set the frag_color.

 frag_color = ... (vec4) ...
 
 The Image entry point enables modifiers to quickly create new post-processing
 functions for VROImageShaderPrograms.
