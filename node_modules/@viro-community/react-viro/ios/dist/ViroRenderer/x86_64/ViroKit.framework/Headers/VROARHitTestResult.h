 Types of hit test results:
 
 ExistingPlaneUsingExtent: Hit test found a plane for which we have an anchor,
                           and the hit location was within the plane's estimated
                           extent.
 ExistingPlane: Hit test found a plane for which we have an anchor, but our hit
                test did not take into account the estimated extent. The hit point
                may be outside the actual extent of the surface.
 EstimatedHorizontalPlane: Hit test found a plane, but one for which we have no 
                           anchor.
 Feature Point: Hit test found a point that the AR session believes is part of a
                continuous surface. This surface may not be horizontal.
