/*
 Anchors are real world objects detected by the AR engine. Each time an
 anchor is detected, the VROARSessionDelegate is given an opportunity to
 create a VRONode with virtual content to attach to that anchor. The
 ARSession will thereafter ensure that the virtual content is fused with
 the real-world anchor, thereby enabling applications to 'augment'
 reality with virtual content.
 
 For example, if a plane anchor is detected, the can use its corresponding 
 VRONode to place virtual objects for a table-top game.
 
 Anchors are regularly updated by the AR engine as the characteristics of 
 the anchor are further refined: for example, the AR engine may start with
 an approximation of a surface, and later determine the surface's width and
 height.
 
 VROARAnchor is subclassed by specific anchor types; planes, image targets, 
 etc.

     There is an *intentional* strong reference cycle between VROARNode and VROARAnchor. Anchors and
     ARNodes are managed in one of two ways:

     1. By the AR subsystem (ARCore). When anchors are bound to trackables, and the bound trackable
        disappears, VROARSessionARCore will remove the corresponding VROARAnchor and its VROARNode.

     2. Manually, by attaching anchors to hit results. In this case, anchors and nodes are removed
        together when the ARNode is detached from the system (see ARNode.detach() in Java).
