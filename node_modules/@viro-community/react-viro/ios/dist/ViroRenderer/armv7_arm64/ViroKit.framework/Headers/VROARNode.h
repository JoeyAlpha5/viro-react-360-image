     There is an *intentional* strong reference cycle between VROARNode and VROARAnchor. Anchors and
     ARNodes are managed in one of two ways:

     1. By the AR subsystem (ARCore). When anchors are bound to trackables, and the bound trackable
        disappears, VROARSessionARCore will remove the corresponding VROARAnchor and its VROARNode.

     2. Manually, by attaching anchors to hit results. In this case, anchors and nodes are removed
        together when the ARNode is detached from the system (see ARNode.detach() in Java).
