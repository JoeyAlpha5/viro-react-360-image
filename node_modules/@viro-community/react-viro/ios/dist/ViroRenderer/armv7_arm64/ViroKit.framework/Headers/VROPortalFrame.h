 Portal frames are nodes that contain the geometry representing the
 entrance (or exit) from the portal. We need these for two reasons:
 
 1. They enable us to manipulate the scale and other transformations
    of the portal's entrance without changing the transform of the entire
    VROPortal.
 
 2. VROPortals need their frames dynamically assigned each frame if the
    active portal changes, in order to render entrances where necessary
    and exits where necessary.

     portal frame, so that only the 'window' gets rendered to the stencil

     If this portal frame is two-sided then this returns the stencil face
     that we should render to the stencil buffer. The other face (the inactive)
     face, will not render to the stencil buffer.
     
     Example:
     
     A --- P --- B
     
     Suppose A and B are two portals separated by portal frame P. Suppose P is
     the 'entrance' to B. Our goal is to have the front face of P display B, and
     the back face display A.
     
     Therefore, if we're "in" portal B, we should render the stencil to the back
     faces of B, and if we're "in" portal A, we should render the stencil to the
     front faces of B. This works because when we don't write to the stencil, we
     simply render the world we're in; so in the former case the front of P will
     render B, and the latter case the back of P will render A.

     Normally, both sides of a portal frame are windows into the same scene. So if
     you are in an AR world and you're looking through a portal into a VR world,
     you can walk around the portal and see the VR world from both sides of the
     portal.
     
     However, it's also useful to sometimes have 2-sided portals: that is,
     a portal which on one side shows the VR world and on the other side the AR
     world. This is particularly useful when we're about to pass through a portal.
     In such cases, we want the portal to show different worlds on each side in
     order to prevent flickering.
     
     Two-sided portals are enabled under the hood by using the front/back stencil
     buffer operations.
